            of its contractors, directors, employees, agents, third party partners, licensors

            its products and services, set its prices, and entered into this agreement in reliance
            upon the warranty disclaimers and the limitations of liability set forth herein,
            that the warranty disclaimers and the limitations of liability set forth herein
            reflect a reasonable and fair allocation of risk between you and BPAY, and that
            the warranty disclaimers and the limitations of liability set forth herein form
            an essential basis of the bargain between you and BPAY. BPAY would not be able to
            provide the services to you on an economically reasonable basis without these limitations.
            Applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental
            or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to
            you. In such cases, BPAY&rsquo;s liability will be limited to the fullest extent
            permitted by applicable law. This paragraph shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
